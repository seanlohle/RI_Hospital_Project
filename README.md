# RI_Hospital_Project
This contains some work from one of my classes where I used a dataset containing data from all the hospitals in Rhode Island and I answer five questions I came up with. Those questions are:

1. What is the average charge for each payer (insurance) over time?
2. What is every patientâ€™s state of residence?
3. What is the average total charge for each hospital?
4. What is the most common race/ethnicity of patients for each hospital?
5. What is the most common month for patients to enter the hospital?

This repository contains a data dictionary as well as my output from my project.
